# odin-local-library

This project creates a website used in a library to manage book data.

# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** NodeJS, Express, PUG, and Mongoose

I followed a tutorial using the technologies mentioned above. Routes, views, controllers, and models were used by me to construct the web pages and database.

# Lesson's Learned:

This project taught me a lot about how backends work together. Learning how to connect my routing, views, controllers, models, and database was necessary for me to build a fully functional website. I learned how these components of a backend work together to build a website.
